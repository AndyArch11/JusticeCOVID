    <h1>Chronic Illnesses in Australian Prisons</h1>
    <p>Data derived from a <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/population-groups/prisoners/overview">AIHW</a> 2018 survey of 802 Australian prisoners, excluding NSW.</p>
    <p>The graphs only show adult prisoners, as they are more likely to be impacted by COVID-19, but additional stats for youth justice can also be found at <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/health-welfare-services/youth-justice/overview">AIHW</a>. 
    The survey captured additional chronic illness prevalence in the Australian prison population than what is shown here, but these graphs only show those chronic illnesses that are understood to pose additional risks of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19</p>
