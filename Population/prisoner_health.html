    <h1>Chronic Illnesses in Australian Prisons</h1>
    <p>Data derived from a <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/population-groups/prisoners/overview">AIHW</a> 2018 survey of 802 Australian prisoners, excluding NSW, as well as broader AIHW and ABS data on Australian population health data</p>
    <p>The graphs only show adult prisoners, as they are more likely to be impacted by COVID-19, but additional stats for youth justice can also be found at <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/health-welfare-services/youth-justice/overview">AIHW</a>. 
    The AIHW survey captured additional chronic illness prevalence in the Australian prison population than what is shown here, but these graphs only show those chronic illnesses that are understood to pose additional risks of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19</p>
    <p>N.B. Not able to source prevalance of Chronic Respiratory Disease or Hypertension in either Indigenous or prison populations, so only showing Australian rates.  Unable to source obesity rates in prison populations, so only showing corresponding broader population rates.</p>
