    <h1>Potential Impact to the Australian Prison Population from COVID-19</h1>
    <p>The following values are hypothetical, but based on current pathology as seen in Australia and overseas. Some modelling predicts up to <a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1541266/correctional-model-predicts-99-covid-19-infection-rate-arizona-prisons">99%</a> infection rates in some US prisons!  
        The numbers are not meant to be predictive but to provide some indication of the potential magnitude of COVID-19 in the Australian adult prison system.  
        As each of these graphs use generalised COVID-19 parameters from a specific perspective that do not account for all of the specifics of the Australian prison and staff population, the numbers in these graphs only serve to provide an indication of the range of potential impacts that could result from COVID-19 infections in the Australian prison system, but are not meant to be predictive.</p>
    <div class="tooltip">
        <label class="label" for="infectious_spread">Spread of Infection</label>
        <input id="infectious_spread" type="number" min="0", max="1", step="0.05", value="0.7", name="Infectious_Spread" title="Spread of Infection"  /> 
        <span class="tooltiptext">Extent of infected population across Australian prisons, value of between 0 to 1.  Assumes that staff and prisoners have similar rates of infection, as seen from overseas.  Currently, overseas are seeing infection rates up to 70% in individual detention centres with some modelling predicting up to 99% infection rates.</span>

    <dl>
        <dt>Uninfected</dt>
        <dd>The number of people in the population that do not contract COVID-19.</dd>
        <dt>Infected Asymptomatic</dt>
        <dd>It is expected that almost all people who are infected with COVID-19 will have a period where they are asymptomatic but contagious. This graph shows the number of people who do not progress beyond this stage.  At present it is not known what percentage of the population don't progress to showing symptoms, but initial studies suggest it is somewhere between 30-50% of all cases, and may be as many as 70% of cases.</dd>
        <dt>Mild Symptomatic</dt>
        <dd>While the symptoms may not feel mild to those in this stage, they are not severe enough to be hospitalised. This graph shows the number of people who do not progress beyond this stage. Initial studies indicated that the percentage of cases that do not progress to hospitalisation account for ~80% of cases.  In Australia, with the testing that is being done, we appear to be seeing more than 90% who do not progress to hospitalisation.</dd>
        <dt>Hospitalised</dt>
        <dd>The number of people who end up being hospitalised.  This is inclusive of those whose condition deteoriates to the point that they end up needing Intensive Care.</dd>
        <dt>Intensive Care</dt>
        <dd>The number of people who end up needing Critical/Intensive Care.  A small number of these will in turn require ventilators.</dd>
        <dt>Dead</dt>
        <dd>The number of people who end up dying from COVID-19, irrespective of what stages they previously went through. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) varies across countries subject to their demographics and level of testing.  The CFR used here is based on the rates in Australia at the beginning of May 2020.</dd>

    <div><p>As one person may have multiple comorbidities, these numbers will be in excess of the actual number of related deaths.  The risk of death from COVID-19 increases significantly with the number of comorbidities that an individual has.</p>
        <p>While the risk factor has been defined for Chronic Respiratory Disease, the prison health statistics do not include these numbers.  While asthma is a form of Chronic Respiratory Disease, it is not the same as emphysema or obstructive pulmonary disease and it is unclear if asthmatics are at increased risk of COVID-19.  As such the use of Chronic Respiratory Disease risk factor against the prison population with Asthma may be providing a misleading potential health risk.</p>
        <p>N.B. Smoking and obesity are also risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes.  However, the risk factor for smoking has not been defined, and while overweight patients are up to 5 times more prevalent in the number of deaths according to a study out of China, the risk of being overweight accounting for other factors has not been defined.  Additionally, I have not been able to find figures on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Australian prison population.</p></div>
